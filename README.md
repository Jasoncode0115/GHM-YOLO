## 2. Usage
### 2.1 Data preparation

![pipeline](./GHM-YOLO_files/dataset.png)

We built a self-collected dataset named SCAR-7D (Student Classroom Activity Recognition Dataset with 7 Classes) to evaluate the generalization of our model in real classroom environments.
The dataset contains 100 lecture videos recorded under strict privacy compliance, covering pre-class, in-class, and post-class periods. Representative keyframes were extracted using a local-extrema frame-difference method (computed every 24 frames), filtering out irrelevant or low-variation frames. After preprocessing, 5,477 high-quality keyframes were obtained and carefully annotated with LabelImg into seven categories of classroom behaviors: reading/writing, using mobile phone, looking down, lying on desk, looking up, turning head, and standing.
